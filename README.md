# Quickstart - JavaScript SDK v12 for Azure Storage

This repository implements the [quickstart](http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-nodejs-v10) sample for the [Azure Storage v12 SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js).

## Set up
First, clone the repository on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-storage-js-v10-quickstart.git
```

Then, switch to the appropriate folder:

```bash
cd azure-storage-js-v10-quickstart
```

Next, install the dependencies:

    npm install

Finally, rename the file `.env.example` to `.env` and add your values for *AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME* and *AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY*.


## Running the sample

```bash
npm start
